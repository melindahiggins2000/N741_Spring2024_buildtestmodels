# N741 - Spring 2024: Build and Test Models

This Rmarkdown shows an example of fitting a simple linear regression model by illustrating these concepts:

1. Splitting a sample dataset into a training and test dataset
2. Fitting and Saving the model from the training dataset
3. Summarize the training model - coefficients and fit statistics
4. Make predictions from the fitted model using the:
    - training data
    - test data
5. Using these predictions - compare to the original data to evaluate the "ability" of the model to make predictions with data it was not trained with (prediction evaluation statistics).
6. Get another different dataset to validate the model
    - make predictions with the model using the validation dataset
    - obtain the prediction evaluation statistics.
